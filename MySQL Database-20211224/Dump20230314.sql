Outputs are activated by an open collector sink or normally open (NO) dry trigger input from an Access Control System, Card Reader, Keypad, Push Button, PIR, etc. Unit will route power to a variety of access control hardware devices including: Mag Locks, Electric Strikes, Magnetic Door Holders, etc. Outputs will operate in both Fail-Safe and/or Fail-Secure modes. The FACP Interface enables Emergency Egress, Alarm Monitoring, or may be used to trigger other auxiliary devices. The fire alarm disconnect feature is individually selectable for any or all of the eight (8) outputs.','https://altronix.com/products/eFLOW102NA8V','','2023-02-02 19:41:13','2023-02-02 19:41:13'),(1238,4,4,43,'Power Supply Charger, Single Output, 12VDC @ 10A, Aux Output, FAI, LinQ2 Ready, 115VAC, Board','EFLOW102NB','Altronix eFlow102NB UL Listed Sub-Assembly power supply/charger converts a 120VAC, 60Hz input into a single 12VDC output.
